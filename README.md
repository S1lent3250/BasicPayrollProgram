# Basic Payroll Program
> Just a simple, basic payroll calculation program written in C++.

# Very basic usage:
```
./payroll 1
./payroll 0
./payroll true
./payroll false
```

# Usage (Explained):
> This program takes either a boolean true/false value or a binary 1/0 value as an argument. Since the program may only take one argument, I thought it would make sense to throw binary into this.
> The binary switch '1' or 'true' will simply print out the value the user entered into the current prompt, whereas the binary switch '0' or 'false' will disable this function.
